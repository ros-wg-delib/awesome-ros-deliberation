> A curated list of awesome tools, libraries and resources for deliberation in ROS 2.

Deliberation is the topmost layer in a robotics architecture sometimes also called mission or planning layer. It aims at controlling the robots behavior towards its extended goal or function. This includes pre-programmed state machines, automated symbolic planning as well as behavioral reaction to unforeseen situations happening at runtime.
